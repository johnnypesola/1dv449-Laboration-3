# 1DV449 Laboration 3 - MashUp

If you want to do some work on this repo locally then first make sure you've got node.js installed. After that run npm install in the root directory to install dependencies needed like angular source files and such which isn't present in this repo. This repo is kind of a compiled version so to say to avoid unneccessary files.
   
And if you wish to compile it as I've done after you have made changes in the javascript or css files. Make sure so you've got Grunt installed and just run the 'grunt' command in the project root. That should be all.
